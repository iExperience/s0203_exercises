5.new.html.erb
6._comment.html.erb - What is the __syntax for again?
7.index.html.erb under treasures - which is what the root is set to in the routes file
8. show.html.erb underneath treasures
9. Treasures: title, description, comments
	Comments: Bru, Comment

10. For treasures: _form.html.erb
Same thing for comments - but under the comments view folder
