    <p>Hi! I'm a Math and Computer Science major at Stanford. I want to learn web development this summer because its a super awesome skill to have that lets you build anything online! I'm really excited to live in Cape Town and can't wait to explore the city and learn more about the culture of South Africa! </p>
    <p>My interests range from playing the violin and the ukulele to white water kayaking. At Stanford, I am part of a Mariachi band!</p>
