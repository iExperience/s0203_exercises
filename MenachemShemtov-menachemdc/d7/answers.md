3. Drawn
4. Creates all the routes that you'll use
5. It shows all the routes that youve just created. I would assume it would be useful for two reasons. a) to verify all routes have been created b) to verify which routes lead to which methods 
6. You would create a controller page with all the methods, and a model page for all the information. (obviously a view page/pages to be able to view content)
7. View - to actually be able to see whats on the page
8. Partials - to avoid repeating the same code
9. ERB - to make the code cleaner
