## E2: Scope It Out

1. 20

2. Step by step:
 * assign local variable 'loudness' a value of 20
 * outputs the string "IT'S SO LOUD"
 * returns loudness, the local variable (value: 20)

3. Value is 10. Because 'loudness' defined inside get_louder is a local variable and will not be considered outside the scope of the method definition. loudness has been declared as 10 outside.
