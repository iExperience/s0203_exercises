1. 20
2. The get_louder method sets loudness to 20, puts "IT'S SO LOUD", then returns the loudness. 
3. 20 because the value of loudness is 10 before running the method, becomes 20 for inside the method, and at the end of the program (once the method has stopped running), it is still 20 because the loudness from inside the method gets returned
