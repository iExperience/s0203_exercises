    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> Originally from Orange County, CA </p>

        <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
          <div class="subheading"> <strong> <h4> Python </h4> <hr> </strong>
          <p> I worked on a project for the Computational Linguistics Lab at Northwestern University. I wrote a script to calculate the similarity of two words based on a Gabor transformation as well as a traditional Linear Transformation. Completely inexperienced with Python at the time, I learned the language comprehensively through trial-and-error; long periods of frustration interspersed with short bursts of elation make for the perfect teacher</p> </div>
          <div class="subheading"> <strong> <h4> C++ </h4> <hr> </strong>
          <p> I completed an introductory course taught in C++. We covered topics extending as far as smart pointers and dynamic memory allocation.  </div>
          <div class="subheading"> <strong> <h4> Java </h4> <hr> </strong>
          <p> My first exposure to Computer Science, through Java I learned the fundamentals of object oriented programming. And I made a pretty cool calculator for physics in mechanics that I wish I had saved on my computer. </p> </div>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <div class="subheading"> <strong> <h4> Running </h4> <hr> </strong>
          <p> I started running in 6th grade, and we've had a love-hate relationship ever since. Hate when I was injured, love when I actually beat my season bests. </p> </div>
          <div class="subheading"> <strong> <h4> Writing </h4> <hr> </strong>
          <p> I enjoy writing things that I know only I'll read. I study David Sedaris's writing in the hope that paying for the New Yorker enough times will make the publication indebted to me, forcing them to publish my stuff when I die.  </div>
